== Description ==
Content optimization is key to search success. Do you ever wonder how your keyword landscape looks like? Clusters of jibberish crawled by search spiders, churned through so many algorithms… What are the prominent keywords in your content **mind you not just the post content**. Your theme, plugins, scripts, post title… there's a lot that comes into play while rendering the markup for search bots.
